    <h1>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p>
      <br>  Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of data and information. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users.
<br>
Although humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the earliest writing systems were developed, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT). Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.
<br>
The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.
<br>
Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC — 1450 AD), mechanical (1450—1840), electromechanical (1840—1940), and electronic (1940 to present).
<br>
Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data. As this field continues to evolve across the world, the overall priority and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the introduction of computer science-related courses

    <h2>Skills for IT Workers</h2>
    <p>
       <b> The skills you need in an IT career will depend on the role you pursue, <br> but there are general skills you’ll need to succeed in one of these roles.
    </b><br>
   <br><b>Analytic skills: </b>  IT pros need to study the computer systems, networks or technology they’re working with to identify threats, problems, vulnerabilities and ways to optimize efficiency.
   <br><b>Communication skills: </b>  IT workers frequently need to collaborate with non-IT professionals,  including computer users and business leaders. Effective communication is needed to clearly explain issues and  problems to users who may not understand technical IT terms. IT work may also include writing reports,  so both verbal and written communication skills are essential.
   <br><b>Multitasking skills: </b>  IT work is often busy and fast-paced.  IT pros must be able to adapt to juggling multiple projects and collaborating with a variety of stakeholders.  Organization is also key so that an IT pro performs the work that’s needed on each project and doesn’t neglect key details.
   <br><b>Problem-solving skills: </b> IT professionals prevent and fix problems related to computer security, systems and networks.  In support specialist roles, they’ll need to help others fix those problems and must make easy-to-understand recommendations.
